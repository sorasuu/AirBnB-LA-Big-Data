81,Your home away from home /sleeps 4/ furnished,none,"Lois and Craig were great hosts and I really enjoyed my stay. Their Internet access is beyond fast - Verizon FIOS fiber to the home. If you are used to the typical awful cable company Internet, or even worse, the typically horribly slow hotel WiFi, staying here with truly fast Internet will be a real treat. If you are traveling without a car, their location is outstanding. They are walking distance to a number of excellent restaurants including a wonderful Indian restaurant called Bombay Tandoori. You are only two blocks away from Pacific Coast Highway where you have access to three bus lines. One line, Commuter Express, operates at the morning and evening rush hours and takes you quickly to and from downtown Los Angeles.

We are very centrally located in the middle of where most tourists want to go.. BEACH, DOWNTOWN, HOLLYWOOD & More! BY CAR - UBER - LYFT - BUS - TRAIN - We are accessible by ALL! (But TAKE AN UBER it's THE BEST CHOICE!) MANY attractions are only 20 mins away..  Situated near Downtown LA, West LA, Southbay, Beaches & Hollywood.. LA POINTS OF INTEREST by CAR 15 minutes to Downtown LA. 20 minutes to LAX Airport. 30 minutes to Venice & Santa Monica Beaches. 20 minutes to Hollywood & Melrose Blvds.  40 minutes to Universal Studios & Citywalk. 45 minutes to Disneyland & Knott's Berry Farm. My ADVICE.. This is LA. Do yourself a favor.. Take UBER or RENT A CAR!!  It's a BIG CITY, Buses are slow, packed & sometimes  who wants to spend their trip waiting for buses?? That said..
